**Preserve-Our-Planet**

Preserve Our Planet app is a simple Sinatra CRUD application to track daily actions taken by users to preserve our planet, it is made to spread awareness of climate change.
The app allows users to sign up, log in, and log out; create, edit and delete their own actions and see all of the other actions created by other users.

This app is developed as a portfolio project for Flatiron School's Online part time Software Engineering Program. 

The template for the app was created with Corneal, a Sinatra app generator that created the file directory and provided preliminary configuration.
