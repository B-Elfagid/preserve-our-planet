    <div class="content">
      <p>Welcome!<br><br>
      
         This website has been made to spread awareness of climate change, 
         as an andividual who lives in this precious planet, what are our daily contributions in order to preserve our planet?
         once Sir David Attenborough said
         “The truth is: the natural world is changing. And we are totally dependent on that world. 
         It provides our food, water and air. It is the most precious thing we have and we need to defend it.”
